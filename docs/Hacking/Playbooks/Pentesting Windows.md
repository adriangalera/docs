# Pentesting Windows

This page contains a playbook of pentesting Windows boxes, refer to [Pentesting](./Pentesting.md) for the generic approach.

## Enumeration

- nmap
- SMB
- LDAP dump
- AD using BloodHound and analyze output of BloodHound with its UI and find shortest path to valuable assets
- MS-SQL xp_dirtree

## Getting foothold

- Brute force users via SMB with crackmapexec
- Password spray the users with crackmapexec
- Connect with evil-winrm (SSH equivalent)
- Shadow credential: when a user has write access to another user `KeyCredentialLink`, the user can write its public key material to it, forcing AD to send the NTLM token to the attacker. Use `certipy-ad shadow auto` to perform this kind of attack.
