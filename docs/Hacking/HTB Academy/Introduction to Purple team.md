## Windows logging

- Sysmon

Sysmon (System Monitor) is a powerful system activity monitoring tool within the Microsoft Sysinternals suite. Sysmon logs can be viewed in the Event Viewer by navigating to Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon.

Sysmon logs are stored as part of the Windows Event Log system. The logs are located on disk at the following default path:

`C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx`

- Command Line Logging

Command Line Logging captures information about processes and their command-line arguments, which is useful for detecting suspicious activity, such as unauthorized execution of commands. The relevant Windows event ID is 4688 (A new process has been created). These can be seen in Windows Event Log, Sysmon and JonMon.

Stored in disk in `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Security.evtx`

- PowerShell Logging

 Script block logging captures the full content of scripts that are executed, including obfuscated or dynamically generated code. This is crucial for detecting sophisticated attacks. The Event ID for Script Block Logging is 4104. PowerShell logs can be viewed in the Event Viewer by navigating to Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell.

 Stored in disk in `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational.evtx`

 - Console History

The console history is stored in the user's profile directory at the following location:

C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt

- Audit policies

Verbose auditing provides comprehensive tracking of both success and failure events across the system. Audit policy logs provide detailed insights into system access, privilege usage, and security settings modifications.

They are stored by default in `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Security.evtx`.

- Windows Firewall Logs

Windows Firewall logs provide detailed information about inbound and outbound network connections, including allowed and blocked connections.

Stored in `C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\pfirewall.log`

here is another event (Event ID 5156) that is logged by the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP), which is responsible for processing network packets.

- JonMon

By combining data from both the kernel-level and user-mode components, JonMon provides users with a comprehensive view of their security activity. This is installed as a service in the host. JonMon-generated logs can be viewed in the Event Viewer by navigating to Applications and Services Logs > JonMon.

- SealighterTI

The Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) provider is a robust tool for detecting process injection and other types of attacks.  SealighterTI facilitates the logging of events from the Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence provider into the Windows Event Log, enhancing visibility into such activities. Runs in the background via a scheduled task.  Applications and Service Logs > Sealighter

## Dumping and analyzing Windows Memory

Memory dumping is a vital capability in forensic investigations, enabling the capture of the current state of a system's volatile memory for detailed post-incident analysis. This snapshot provides a wealth of information, such as active processes, loaded drivers, network connections, and potential malicious artifacts that may not be visible on disk.

We can use `DumpIt` or `WinPmem` to create a full memory dump.

To analyze the memory, we'll use `Volatility v2/3`.
