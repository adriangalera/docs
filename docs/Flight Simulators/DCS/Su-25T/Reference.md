### Bombs

There are two modes of dropping an un-guided bomb: https://www.openflightschool.de/mod/book/view.php?id=792

The symbol `b` appears in the HUD when a bomb is selected.

#### CCIP

Continuously Computed Impact Point. 

Deep dive into the objective

A vertical line will appear, when the piper is in the objective trigger the joystick

#### CCRP

Continuously Computed Release Point.

Flight level and point the piper where you want to drop the bomb.

Press the joystick trigger and keep flying leveled towards the point.

There's a distance indicator in the left side of the HUD, when the indicator reaches the lowest point, the bomb will be released automatically.

### Missiles

Point the skhrval sensor to the target. 

Make the reticule smaller as possible and adapt the size of the reticule to the kind of target:

- MANPAD: 5m
- Tank: 10m
- Building: 30-60m

When shkrval acquires the lock, you will see NP (Launch authorized).

With the vickr missiles you don't actually need the lock, they will follow the laser. If you spot something before the locking, you can shoot as soon as you are in the required distance.
