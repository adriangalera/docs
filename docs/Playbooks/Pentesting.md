While performing pentesting, there are a series of steps that are always the same. The steps are (sorted by order)

## Enumeration

Using [nmap](../tooling/nmap) the attacker needs to see what is open in the target machine.

At this stage, we'll behave like a legitimate user, e.g.: perform regular searches, etc...

If `nmap` shows some web server, it's worth to check the following enumeration techniques.

### Directory brute-foce

This is a technique to discover all public paths of a website. There might situation where the web server is serving something but it's not referenced anywhere on the website. This is know as well as dir busting.

The technique consist in using a list of words and try all the combinations in the dictionary to see if the web server returns a positive (e.g. 200 OK) answer to the page. If so, we have discovered a page in that path.

There are many tools to perform this such as [gobuster](../tooling/gobuster) and [ffuf](../tooling/ffuf).

You can use as well the sitemap functionality in the burp suite.

### Sub-domain brute force

This techniques tries to discover sub-domains configured, you can do it by checking the DNS records or the virtual hosts configured in a server.

Usually this works by providing values in the HTTP Host header.

There are many tools to perform this such as [gobuster](../tooling/gobuster) and [ffuf](../tooling/ffuf).

### Robots.txt

It's always interesting to check the contents of robots.txt, for instance here, the file reveals the server hosts a joomla CMS:

```
# If the Joomla site is installed within a folder
# eg www.example.com/joomla/ then the robots.txt file
# MUST be moved to the site root
# eg www.example.com/robots.txt
# AND the joomla folder name MUST be prefixed to all of the
# paths.
# eg the Disallow rule for the /administrator/ folder MUST
# be changed to read
# Disallow: /joomla/administrator/
#
# For more information about the robots.txt standard, see:
# https://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html

User-agent: *
Disallow: /administrator/
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /bin/
Disallow: /cache/
Disallow: /cli/
Disallow: /components/
Disallow: /includes/
Disallow: /installation/
Disallow: /language/
Disallow: /layouts/
Disallow: /libraries/
Disallow: /logs/
Disallow: /modules/
Disallow: /plugins/
Disallow: /tmp/
```

It also gives an idea of possible paths into the application
